# Inventory App

This is the final project for the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree program. This 2-part project consisted of the design and creation of the structure of an Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app allows the user to add products to a data base, checks for correct data, allows purchasing and ordering via an intent to a phone app.
